Questions from a Design Perspective:

1. Would you like to keep the current color scheme or are we able to use colors besides a white dominate palette?

2. When you say you want to make a single page, do you mean you want all the content confined to a single page? Or single pages per section ones that don’t require the viewer to scroll?

3. Do you want to implement a slider to highlight key information about the gym? IE. monthly deals, programs available, services available, etc...

4. Does your newsletter need to be designed as well?

5. Is the logo you’re currently have the logo you wish to stick with or are you looking for re-branding as well??

Questions from a Development Perspective:

6. Understandably, in order to fairly reward prizes there would have to be more than an honor system in place. Should it be a requirement for members to submit videos for the purpose of tracking their progress?

7. The requirement of uploading proof/media could turn away some potential users who would otherwise still use the site to track progress anyway. Would it be appropriate to allow any members to record their progress with just a photo and a form entry, rather than requiring a video?

8. What elements of your current site design and functionality are you most fond of?

9. Rewarding members with prizes may require continued maintenance on the site (unless the prize/goal is consistent). Perhaps instead of (or in addition to) actual prizes, what do you think of members earning virtual badges to reward them for their progress?

10. What sort of aesthetic/general feel would you want to have for the site??

Questions from a Management Perspective:

11. What kind of timeframe are we looking at?

12. What's the budget?

13. You said something about targeting local businesses with a special program for them, what kind of business' were you thinking about?

14. As far as the uploading of videos, if you still choose to do that. How? Youtube, other video uploading sites, or are you talking about one built into your site?

15. Can you explain to us, what is really different about your gym? It may spark some ideas for design and/or new things to develop.
